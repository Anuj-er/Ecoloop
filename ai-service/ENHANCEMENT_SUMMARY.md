# AI Service Enhancement Summary

## Enhancements Completed

1. **Added Comprehensive Testing Endpoint**
   - Created `/test` endpoint that validates all components of the image analysis pipeline
   - Tests model loading, category mapping, OpenCV functionality, and full analysis pipeline
   - Can be run with or without a test image URL
   - Reports detailed test results with pass/fail status

2. **Created Testing Tools**
   - Implemented `test_client.py` - CLI tool for testing individual images with detailed reports
   - Implemented `batch_test.py` - Batch testing tool that validates behavior across different image categories
   - Added support for CSV and JSON report generation

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive information about new features
   - Added detailed API endpoint documentation
   - Added status values and rejection/flag reason explanations
   - Added testing tool documentation

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added better handling for connection and timeout issues
   - Added fallbacks when services are unavailable
   - Improved diagnostics and reporting

## Features Now Available
